## [1.0.6.7] - 2026-09-16
1. Extended support for Debian 13 ARM64 platform.
2. Automated removal of existing QUD Debian packages during QUD installation via QSC/QPM.
3. Automated removal of existing QUD Userspace Debian packages during QUD installation via QSC/QPM.
4. Improved QSC/QPM cli error reporting on terminal during QUD driver installation.

1. First Debian package release of QUD v1.0.6.3 is now available on GitHub. Users can modify the driver source and generate a Debian package using the build-deb.sh script.
2. Updated the installer script to automatically install kernel headers for the running kernel seamlessly across multiple platforms including Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, and Fedora.[QUD-1881]
3. Fix DIAG and QDLoader “Could not open connection” issue caused by a subsystem mismatch between driver and udev rules [QUD-1880], [QUD-1882]

1. The `qcom_usb` driver is now fully compliant with kernel open-source standards.
2. Device probing speed for both `qcom_usb` and `qcom_usbnet` drivers has been significantly improved by removing Infparser module dependencies, reducing kernel memory usage by 16,384 bytes and ensuring cleaner kernel logs.
3. Resolved a rare driver crash caused by internal memory fragmentation.
4. Optimized the `qcom_usb` driver, reducing the kernel memory footprint by 61,440 bytes.
5. Improved power management by addressing the runtime PM usage undercount issue.
6. Improved efficiency by implementing kernel `list_head` for the notify list instead of maintaining a custom list.
7. Simplified the driver installation process, allowing users to modify and test individual drivers faster and more efficiently without relying on the `qcom_drivers.sh` installer script. Detailed steps are provided in the README.md located at `/opt/qcom/QUD/`.
8. Minimized spin lock usage, enhancing overall concurrency and system responsiveness in both the `qcom_usb` and `qcom_usbnet` drivers.
9. Fixed an issue to prevent I/O operations from being triggered during disconnect events.

**Note:**
- The `QdssDiag` driver is now renamed to `qcom_usb`.
- The `GobiNet` driver is now renamed to `qcom_usbnet`.
- The `qtiDevInf` module is now deprecated and no longer required.
